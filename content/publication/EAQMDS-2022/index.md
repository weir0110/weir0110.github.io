abstract: In this paper, we mainly use generalized Reed–Solomon codes to construct two classes of entanglement-assisted quantum MDS codes (EAQMDS codes for brevity), whose parameters are not covered by previously known ones. Moreover, the lengths of these EAQMDS codes are not divisors of , and the parameter c, the number of entangled bits, is more flexible.
